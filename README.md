*"Peace of mind for the journey back home"*

**1.What goal will your website be designed to achieve?**  

Intended to be an additional step in your preparation for a hike, TrekAssure generates an “after-the-hike” pamphlet that can be downloaded and emailed. The pamphlet contains a set of static directions from the trail to your home. It also includes directions to a few key emergency locations nearest to the trail. Why static directions? It’s for those times when you’re hiking in the middle of nowhere, and you have no cell reception to map your way. I made this because there are so many apps for hiking trail description and discovery, apps that will get you there. But when you’ve finished with your hike, when you’re exhausted, when you have no idea where you are and Google Maps is on the fritz, suddenly having a set of static directions seems a lot more valuable.

**2.What kind of users will visit your site? In other words, what is the demographic of your users?**  

My site can benefit anyone interested in the outdoors and hiking. I'm hoping that TrekAssure can help promote interest in hiking and other outdoor activities. 

**3.What data do you plan on using? You may have not picked your actual API yet,which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain.**  

TrekAssure requires two separate API keys for full functionality: 

Trail data from [Hiking Project API](https://www.hikingproject.com/data)  
Geocoding, routing, and mapping from [Mapquest API](https://developer.mapquest.com/)  

**4. Current plans for expansion:**
- Functionality on mobile
- Customizable destination results
- "On route" destination results 
- User query destination results 
- File type choice for pamphlets (pdf would be ideal)
- "Update all stored pamphlets" functionality
